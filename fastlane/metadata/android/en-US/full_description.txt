Tired of banking and other financial apps whining that Developer Options is on? With <em>DevQS</em>, Developer Options can be toggled off then back on from the Quick Settings panel without resetting other settings. Long-clicking on any of the tiles will also open the Developer Options settings screen if the DEV toggle is on.

IMPORTANT:
There is no launcher icon nor activity. The tiles must be manually added to the Quick Settings panel. The app requires the permission WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS which can be granted using ADB.
